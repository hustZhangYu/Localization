# Functions about localization
We have collected some commonly used functions when studying Anderson localization and quasi-periodic localization, such as  Ipr and energy level statistics.
 
## Plot
1. (EVIprPlot) :we use the code (EVIprPlot) to plot this figure.

## wavefunction
1.（Ipr）： calculate the Ipr for a single eigenstate.

## Dynamics
1. (x2) : claculate <x^2>

## Scaling
1. (scalingexponent) : get the scalingexponent by the system size and IPR data.
